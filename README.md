# VR-CESM

VR-CESM model setup at NERSC for the simulation VR14_FOG_BASE.<br>
This simulation uses CESM version 1.5.5, with CAM5 + CLM4 and Variable-Resolution setting with the highest resolution of 14km over Western US.<br>
Grid mesh is shown in Fig2.pdf.<br>

user_nl* files specify input files and output variables from each model components.<br>
env_* files are used to setup model:<br>
Note: env_mach* files are based on the system configuration of NERSC Cori.
